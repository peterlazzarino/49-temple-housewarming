Aurora Chloe Lazzarino was born in December of 2010 on Cape Cod. At just 8 weeks old, she moved to Providence, Rhode Island where she first met her best friend Porscha and developed her deep passion for rides in the car. 

### "Bark bark bark" - Aurora ###

In the cold beginning of 2013, she moved to Boston. Aurora loved the Beacon Hill area for its historic streets and many squirrels, but longed for a quieter home away from holiday fireworks displays. She has now settled in the up-and-coming Winter Hill area of Somerville. She can often be seen exploring the cityâ€™s many parks and being pet by cute children. 

## She prefers being scratched on the butt. ##
