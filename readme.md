# Museumn Audio Guide (Modified for my housewarming party) 

A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator theme for building lightweight audio tours for exhibitions or museums.

## Overview

Based on [Static Museum Audio Guide App](https://github.com/ACMILabs/static-museum-audio-guide)

This template is built on top of the [Jekyll new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new) theme by [Joel Glovier](http://joelglovier.com/). While it is reusable in its current form, it was purpose built for the Scorsese Exhibition at ACMI. Take a look at a live version, and view the [Scorsese Audio Guide](https://guides.acmi.net.au/scorsese/welcome).
